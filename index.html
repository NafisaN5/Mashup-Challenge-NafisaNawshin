    <!--Introduction-->
<p class="intro"> I have three different pets, and they are all my favorite for different reasons. I feed them and give them water every day, and even though it's a lot of work, they are totally worth it.</p>

    <!-- Every pet and their descriptions -->
    <div class="pet">
      <h2 class="type">Lula</h2>
      <img src="Puppy.jpg" alt="Lula the dog" />
     
      <p class="description">Lula's been my dog for two years, and she's really fun to play with. I like to take her to the park. Her favorite toy is an old tennis ball.</p>

    <div class="pet">
      <h2 class="type">Slowpoke</h2>
      <img src="Turtle.jpg" alt="Slowpoke the Turtle">
      <p class="description">Slowpoke is my turtle. I have had him for as long as I can remember, but he became mine for real when I turned 10 because I promised to take care of him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="pet">
      <h2 class="type">Hamster</h2>
      <img src="Fish.jpg" alt="Hamster the Fish">
      <p class="description">Hamster is the name of my fish. I named him hamster because I wanted a hamster and not a fish, but I like him anyway. He basically just swims around all day, but I still like him.</p>
